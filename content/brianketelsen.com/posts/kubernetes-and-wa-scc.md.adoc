Youtube video of a waSCC actor running on Krustlet.  Web Assembly on Kubernetes!

== Kubernetes and waSCC

Earlier this week, https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-krustlet/[the Deis Labs team announced Krustlet], a Kubernetes kubelet implementation written in Rust that executes Web Assembly.

I pitched in on this release, especially on the https://wascc.dev/[waSCC] provider.
I thought it would be fun to live-stream the creation of a waSCC actor and show it running in Kubernetes.

Here's the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy91W7OxHcQ[video] on Youtube.

Here's the https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/pull/174[pull request] adding the demo.
