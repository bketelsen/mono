Download and install Go on macOS

== Mac Installation

{download} the macOS Package installer for the current release of Go.  Open the installer.  It will put your Go installation in `/usr/local/go`.

=== Modified Path

The installer also changes your `PATH` environment variable to add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your path.  You'll need to log out and log back in for these changes to take effect.


=== Verify Installation

After rebooting or logging out and logging in again, your new `PATH` should be applied.  You can verify that the `go` command is available by checking the version:

----
$ go version
go version go1.14.2 darwin/amd64
----
