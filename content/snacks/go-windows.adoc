Download and install Go in Windows

== Windows Installation

{download} the Windows installer MSI file for the current release of Go.  Open the installer.  It will put your Go installation in `C:\Go`.

=== Modified Path

The installer also changes your `PATH` environment variable to add `C:\Go\bin` to your path.  You'll need to log out and log back in for these changes to take effect.

=== Verify Installation

After rebooting or logging out and logging in again, your new `PATH` should be applied.  You can verify that the `go` command is available by checking the version:

----
$ go version
go version go1.14.2 windows/amd64
----
